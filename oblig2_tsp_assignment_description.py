# In this assignment you are going to implement a random algorithm and a greedy algorithm for
# generating a starting solution (phase 1)  for the traveling salesman problem.

# Thereafter, you are going to improve the starting solutions produced by the random algorithm and greedy algorithm
# using greedy improvement algorithm. Test the algorithm with problems having 200 cities, 500 cities and 1000 cities.

# What is your conclusion ?
